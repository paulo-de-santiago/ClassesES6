// Stack, data structure, has essecially two operations: push and pop

//Implement stack class
// call new object: const stack = new Stack()
//stack , count property, three methods in the prototype: peek(), pop(), push()

//peek() returns the object at the top of the stack

//push("a") count = 1
//pop ("a") count = 0
// stack.pop() and stack.peek()  throw new Error ("Stack is empty.")

//uma vari√°vel stackPile  const _stackPile = new WeakMap() . set

// _count = new WeakMap()
// _stackPile = new WeakMap()
// _pop = new WeakMap()
// _push = new WeakMap()
// peek = new WeakMap()

//Define which ones go in the constructor and which ones go in the prototype
